# Preview

When you're working with your timeline, adding clips and gaps, arranging them
in sequences and parallels, you may want to preview the rendered result. Doing
a full [render](rendering.md) can take some time, so while you're working on
a project, use preview to see your intermediate results.

Press the space bar on your keyboard to start a preview. This will
preview the currently focused part of the timeline. To stop the
preview, press the spacebar again.
