Komposition is an early-stage software project. You should expect some rough
edges. If you find a bug, or a place where documentation could be better,
please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/owickstrom/komposition).

If you want to help develop Komposition, look around the reported issues on
Github if there's anything you can pick up. However, as this is a highly
opinionated piece of software, discussion prior to any change is highly
encouraged. It would be very sad to reject your pull request becuase it
hasn't been properly planned beforehand.

Another very helpful thing you can do to help is to spread the
word. This is a non-funded open-source code project run by volunteers,
and all boosts are of great value.
